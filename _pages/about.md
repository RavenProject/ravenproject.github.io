  <h2>What is Ravencoin?</h2>

  <p>Ravencoin is a digital peer to peer network that aims to implement a use case specific blockchain, designed to efficiently handle one specific function: the transfer of assets from one party to another. Built on a fork of the Bitcoin code, Ravencoin was launched January 3rd, 2018, and is a truly open source project (no ICO or masternodes). It focuses on building a useful technology, with a strong and rapidly growing community.</p>

  <h3>How Ravencoin works</h3>

  <p>A Ravencoin post on&nbsp;<em>Medium</em>&nbsp;from November 2017 references Game of Thrones when introducing this experimental currency:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “In the fictional world of Westeros, ravens are used as messengers who carry statements of truth. Ravencoin is a use case specific blockchain designed to carry statements of truth about who owns what assets”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Launched on January 3rd, 2018, the ninth anniversary of Bitcoin’s launch, Ravencoin is an open-source project designed to enable payments to anyone around the world. The aim of the project is to create a blockchain optimized specifically for the transfer of assets such as tokens from one holder to another.</p>

  <p>A fork of the bitcoin code, Ravencoin features four key changes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The issuance schedule (block reward of 5,000 RVN)</li>
    <li>Block time (1 minute)</li>
    <li>Coin supply (21 Billion)</li>
    <li>Mining algorithm (X16R)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This algorithm was intended to address the centralization of mining caused by ASIC hardware. In the X16R&nbsp;<a href="/assets/documents/X16R-Whitepaper.pdf">algorithm paper</a>, the team behind the currency explains that the fixed order of ordinary hashing algorithms lends itself to the construction of ASIC miners.</p>

  <p>However, X16R ASIC's have since been produced so the chain forked them off (without a BIP) to a new algo X16Rv2, which the chinese then made ASIC's for too. The community has now realized that ASIC's are impossible to keep of the chain. </p>

  <h3>Unique characteristics of Ravencoin</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Uses unique X16Rv2 algorithm</li>
    <li>Fair launch - Everyone has equal opportunity to mine or purchase RVN since day one.</li>
    <li>No pre-mine, no ICO, and no coins held for developer or founders rewards.</li>
    <li>Community Driven, and True Open Source</li>
  </ul>
