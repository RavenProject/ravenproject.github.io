    <h2>How can I mine Ravencoin?</h2>
    <p>Designed to be mined on readily available consumer-grade hardware, Ravencoin uses a new algorithm known as KAWPOW. Itâ€™s designed to be Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) resistant and is designed to be efficient on consumer GPU hardware.</p>
    <p>To start mining RVN, you will first need to create a wallet and generate a wallet address that your RVN can be paid into. Next, choose a mining pool.</p>

    <p class="mb-8">Ravencoin (RVN) is supported by the following mining pools:</p>
    <div class="flex flex-wrap">
      {% assign sorted_pools = site.data.pools | sort: "name" %}
      {% for pool in sorted_pools %}
      <div class="mb-2 px-2 sm:w-1/2 md:w-1/3 text-center">
        <div class="bg-grey-lighter max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-md hover:by-grey">
          <span class="mb-0"><a class="block p-4" href="{{ pool.url }}" target="_blank">{{ pool.name }}</a></span>
        </div>
      </div>
      {% endfor %}
    </div>

    <h3>Other options</h3>
    <p>While these are not mining pools in the traditional sense, you can also mine Ravencoin with following platforms.</p>
