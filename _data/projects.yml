- name: Atomic Swaps
  description: >
    Atomic swaps allow for on-chain trades between ravencoin and ravencoin assets, or between two different ravencoin
    assets. This provides all the needed functionality to make Buy, Sell, and Trade orders that others may execute at
    will. In addition, these partial orders can be specially signed such that they are easily shared and completable
    by another party, allowing for clean 2-step orders where that can be shared through any number of side-channels.
