  description: >
    The Electrum Ravencoin wallet is meant to be a light weight wallet for users who are unable or unwilling
    to run a full ravencoin core wallet as well as allow for hardware support for users. It runs on a "shared node" system
    where users can wrap an electrum server around a Ravencoin node which allows electrum clients to get information about
    their addresses.
